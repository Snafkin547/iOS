# iOS ðŸ“±

Welcome to my repository where I've taken my first steps into the exciting world of iOS development! 
This repository is a showcase of my learning journey, featuring two initial projects that I've built by following tutorials from iOS Academy on YouTube. 

## Projects ðŸš§
### RandomPhoto ðŸ“¸

The RandomPhoto app is a simple yet engaging project that demonstrates the basics of integrating network requests within an iOS app. 
By tapping into a public API, the app fetches and displays a random photo every time the user presses a button. 
This was my introduction to the world of APIs, URLSession, and async image loading in Swift.


### EmojiLover ðŸ˜™

Tutorial Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqTcAzPS3oc&t=907s">EmojiLover Tutorial</a>

EmojiLover is an app that was built to dive deeper into the UIKit and explore how to handle user input, collection views, and pass data between views. This project allowed me to create an interface where users can express their love for emojis by favoriting them and seeing a customized list of their choices.

Key Learning Points: ðŸ“ƒ

- Implementing UICollectionViews.
- Making network requests in Swift.
- Understanding the Swift UI lifecycle.
- Utilizing Manual Layout for buttons and frames
